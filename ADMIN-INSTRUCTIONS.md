# Work IQ - Tenant Administrator Enablement Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for Microsoft 365 tenant administrators to enable Work IQ for their organization. Work IQ is a CLI tool and Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that connects AI assistants to Microsoft 365 data, enabling natural language queries across emails, meetings, documents, Teams, and contacts.

## Quick Start (For Admins with Copilot Licenses)

If your organization already has Microsoft 365 Copilot licenses, you can enable Work IQ in minutes:

1. Open this URL in your browser (replace `{your-tenant-id}` with your tenant ID or domain):

```text
https://login.microsoftonline.com/{your-tenant-id}/adminconsent?client_id=ba081686-5d24-4bc6-a0d6-d034ecffed87
```

2. Sign in with your admin account
3. Click **Accept** to grant consent for your entire organization

That's it! Users with Copilot licenses can now install and use Work IQ. See [User Installation and Setup](#step-5-user-installation-and-setup) for end-user instructions.

### 2.2 Configure Update Channels

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, go to **Settings** > **Org settings**
2. Navigate to **Services** > **Office installation options**
3. Ensure your organization uses a supported update channel:
   - **Current Channel** (Recommended)
   - **Monthly Enterprise Channel**
   - **Current Channel (Preview)**

> **Important:** Semi-Annual Enterprise Channel is NOT supported for Copilot.

### 2.3 Configure Copilot Settings

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, navigate to **Copilot**
2. Review and configure:
   - Data security and compliance controls

## Step 3: Grant Admin Consent (Alternative Methods)

If you haven't used the [Quick Start](#quick-start-for-admins-with-copilot-licenses) method, here are alternative ways to grant admin consent.

### 3.1 Grant Consent via Microsoft Entra Admin Center

#### Option A: Grant Consent After User Sign-in Attempt

When a user first tries to use Work IQ:

1. They will see a consent prompt indicating admin approval is required
2. The application will automatically be registered in your tenant
3. Follow these steps to grant consent:
   - Go to **Microsoft Entra admin center** at https://entra.microsoft.com
   - Navigate to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Enterprise applications**
   - Find the **Work IQ CLI** application in the list
   - Select **Permissions** under **Security**
   - Review all requested permissions
   - Click **Grant admin consent for [Your Organization]**
   - Click **Accept**

#### Option B: Pre-authorize via Admin Consent Request (If Configured)

If your tenant has admin consent workflow enabled:

1. Sign in to the **Microsoft Entra admin center** at https://entra.microsoft.com
2. Navigate to **Identity** > **Applications** > **Admin consent requests**
3. Look for pending requests related to Work IQ
4. Review the requested permissions
5. Click **Review permissions and consent**
6. Click **Accept** to grant tenant-wide consent

### 3.2 Grant Consent via PowerShell

For administrators who prefer scripted deployment.

**Prerequisites:** Install the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK if not already installed:

```powershell
# Install Microsoft Graph PowerShell module (run as Administrator)
Install-Module Microsoft.Graph -Scope CurrentUser

# Or update if already installed
Update-Module Microsoft.Graph
```

**Grant admin consent:**

```powershell
# Connect to Microsoft Graph with required scopes
Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "Application.ReadWrite.All", "DelegatedPermissionGrant.ReadWrite.All"

# Get the Work IQ service principal (after a user has attempted sign-in)
$workIqApp = Get-MgServicePrincipal -Filter "displayName eq 'Work IQ CLI'"

# Get Microsoft Graph service principal
$graphSp = Get-MgServicePrincipal -Filter "displayName eq 'Microsoft Graph'"

# Define the required permissions scope
$requiredScopes = "Sites.Read.All Mail.Read People.Read.All OnlineMeetingTranscript.Read.All Chat.Read ChannelMessage.Read.All ExternalItem.Read.All"

# Create the permission grant
$params = @{
    ClientId = $workIqApp.Id
    ConsentType = "AllPrincipals"
    ResourceId = $graphSp.Id
    Scope = $requiredScopes
}

New-MgOauth2PermissionGrant -BodyParameter $params

# Verify the grant was successful
Get-MgOauth2PermissionGrant -Filter "clientId eq '$($workIqApp.Id)'"
```

---

## Step 4: Configure User Access

### 4.1 Verify Application Access

After granting admin consent:

1. Go to **Microsoft Entra admin center** > **Enterprise applications**
2. Find and select the Work IQ CLI application
3. Go to **Users and groups**
4. By default, all users with Copilot licenses can access the application

### 4.2 Restrict Access (Optional)

If you want to limit which users can use Work IQ:

1. In the Work IQ CLI enterprise application, go to **Properties**
2. Set **Assignment required?** to **Yes**
3. Go to **Users and groups**
4. Click **+ Add user/group**
5. Select the users or groups that should have access
6. Click **Assign**

### 4.3 Configure Conditional Access (Recommended)

For additional security, create a Conditional Access policy:

1. Go to **Microsoft Entra admin center** > **Protection** > **Conditional Access**
2. Create a new policy
3. Configure:
   - **Users:** All users or specific groups
   - **Target resources:** Select Work IQ application
   - **Conditions:** Configure as needed (location, device, etc.)
   - **Grant:** Require MFA, compliant device, or other controls

## Security Considerations

### Data Access

Work IQ provides access to sensitive organizational data including:
- Email content
- Meeting transcripts
- Teams messages
- SharePoint/OneDrive documents

   - Only enable Work IQ for users who need it
   - Use assignment-required settings to control access

2. **Monitor Usage**
   - Review audit logs for Work IQ activity
   - Use Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps for additional monitoring

3. **Data Loss Prevention**
   - Ensure DLP policies are in place
   - Configure sensitivity labels for classified content

4. **Regular Review**
   - Periodically audit who has access to Work IQ
   - Review consent grants in Enterprise applications

### Compliance Notes

- Work IQ respects your organization's access controls during conversations
- Data accessed through Work IQ is subject to your existing compliance policies
- The Chat API is currently in beta; review Microsoft's terms for production use limitations
